# Comparing Language Models in English Grammar Correction

Grammatical error correction corrects grammatical, spelling, and word usage errors in texts. Detecting and correcting these errors makes it difficult for the reader to understand the text and negatively affects communication. Editors and proofreaders can identify and correct grammatical errors while reading texts. However, this manual correction takes a long time. With the development of technology, artificial intelligencesupported tools have been developed that automatically correct errors. In artificial intelligence-supported systems, this task is usually performed using natural language processing methods. In this study, a traditional neural network architecture (Attention BiLSTM) and a converter-based language model (T5) were trained. Then, the success of these trained models and major language models (ChatGPT, GoogleBard, LanguageTool) in English grammatical error correction was measured and compared in the test data. In the study, the success of the models
was measured on the JFLEG test data, and the pre-trained T5 language model was the most successful in all metrics.
